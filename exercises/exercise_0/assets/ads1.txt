About the team

The Data Platform team is newly formed and it will have two main roles in play, Data Engineer and Analytics Engineer. We have already developed a comprehensive way of working for ourselves and our stakeholders and built our solutions on a modern data stack using FiveTran, Python, DBT, GCP and Snowflake for data ingestion, storage and modeling with Tableau as our primary data visualization product.


What you will be doing

Within the Data Platform team, you will get the chance to shape how Instabee builds its data platform which is serving many stakeholders in the organization and enables us to make better decisions. The data platform is a key asset that we use for multiple data processing purposes; while traditional BI is one use case we deploy, we also service data science investigations and create endpoints for our technology teams to use in our products and services.

As a Data Engineer you will take the lead on setting integration patterns from sources, as well as building and migrating source integrations for the data platform. You will also be part of the team setting up and maintaining data platform infrastructure.

About us

In 2022, Instabee was founded after combining Budbee and Instabox - two leading last-mile delivery companies with three consumer-facing brands: Budbee, Instabox, and Porterbuddy. Instabee serves millions of consumers across Europe with convenient deliveries and is on track to become the leading European e-commerce enabler. Always with the consumer at heart.

We’re fast, both in terms of parcel delivery and when it comes to growing our business. So far our journey has taken us from Sweden to the rest of Scandinavia and parts of continental Europe, but we have no plans on stopping anytime soon. As we continue to expand, the complexity of Instabee grows in parallel. With that in mind, we’re now looking for you to help us on the journey ahead.
